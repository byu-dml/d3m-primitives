For example, a primitive can start a potentially long optimization\nprocess to compute outputs. ``timeout`` and ``iterations`` can serve as a way for a caller\nto guide the length of this process.\n\nIdeally, a primitive should adapt its call to try to produce the best outputs possible\ninside the time allocated.

The purpose of ``timeout`` is to give opportunity to a primitive to cleanly\nmanage its state instead of interrupting execution from outside. Maintaining stable internal\nstate should have precedence over respecting the ``timeout`` (caller can terminate the\nmisbehaving primitive from outside anyway). If a longer ``timeout`` would produce\ndifferent outputs, then ``CallResult``'s ``has_finished`` should be set to ``False``.\n\nSome primitives have internal iterations (for example, optimization iterations).\nFor those, caller can provide how many of primitive's internal iterations\nshould a primitive do before returning outputs.
