This means that one has to inspect which arguments are accepted at runtime, or in\nother words, one has to inspect which exactly subclass a primitive implements, if\nyou are accepting a wider range of primitives. This relaxation is allowed only for\nstandard subclasses found in this package. Primitives themselves should not break\nthe Liskov substitution principle but should inherit from a suitable base class.\n\nParameters\n----------\ninputs : Inputs\n    The inputs.\noutputs : Outputs\n    The outputs."
