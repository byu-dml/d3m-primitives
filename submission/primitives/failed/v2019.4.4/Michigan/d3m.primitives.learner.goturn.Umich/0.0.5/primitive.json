Primitives should make iterations as\nsmall as reasonable. If ``iterations`` is ``None``, then there is no limit on\nhow many iterations the primitive should do and primitive should choose the best amount\nof iterations on its own (potentially controlled through hyper-parameters).\nIf ``iterations`` is a number, a primitive has to do those number of iterations,\nif possible. ``timeout`` should still be respected and potentially less iterations\ncan be done because of that. Primitives with internal iterations should make\n``CallResult`` contain correct values.\n\nFor primitives which do not have internal iterations, any value of ``iterations``\nmeans that they should run fully, respecting only ``timeout``.\n\nParameters\n----------\ninputs : Inputs\n    The inputs of shape [num_inputs, ...].\ntimeout : float\n    A maximum time this primitive should take to produce outputs during this method call, in seconds.\niterations : int\n    How many of internal iterations should the primitive do.\n\nReturns\n-------\nCallResult[Outputs]\n    The outputs of shape [num_inputs, ...] wrapped inside ``CallResult``."
