For example, a call to ``fit`` could during normal execution\ninfluences what a later ``produce`` call outputs. But during ``can_accept`` call we can directly have\naccess to arguments which would have been given to ``fit`` to produce metadata of the ``produce`` call.\n\nNot all primitive arguments have to be provided, only those used by ``fit``, ``set_training_data``,\nand produce methods, and those used by the ``method_name`` method itself.\n\nParameters\n----------\nmethod_name : str\n    Name of the method which would be called.\narguments : Dict[str, Union[Metadata, type]]\n    A mapping between argument names and their metadata objects (for pipeline arguments) or types (for other).\nhyperparams : Hyperparams\n    Hyper-parameters under which the method would be called during regular primitive execution.\n\nReturns\n-------\nDataMetadata\n    Metadata object of the method call result, or ``None`` if arguments are not accepted\n    by the method."

If this is not possible and the primitive reaches the timeout\nbefore fitting, it should raise a ``TimeoutError`` exception to signal that fitting was\nunsuccessful in the given time. The state of the primitive after the exception should be\nas the method call has never happened and primitive should continue to operate normally.\nThe purpose of ``timeout`` is to give opportunity to a primitive to cleanly manage\nits state instead of interrupting execution from outside. Maintaining stable internal state\nshould have precedence over respecting the ``timeout`` (caller can terminate the misbehaving\nprimitive from outside anyway). If a longer ``timeout`` would produce different fitting,\nthen ``CallResult``'s ``has_finished`` should be set to ``False``.\n\nSome primitives have internal fitting iterations (for example, epochs). For those, caller\ncan provide how many of primitive's internal iterations should a primitive do before returning.\nPrimitives should make iterations as small as reasonable. If ``iterations`` is ``None``,\nthen there is no limit on how many iterations the primitive should do and primitive should\nchoose the best amount of iterations on its own (potentially controlled through\nhyper-parameters). If ``iterations`` is a number, a primitive has to do those number of\niterations (even if not reasonable), if possible. ``timeout`` should still be respected\nand potentially less iterations can be done because of that.

For example, a primitive can start a potentially long optimization\nprocess to compute outputs. ``timeout`` and ``iterations`` can serve as a way for a caller\nto guide the length of this process.\n\nIdeally, a primitive should adapt its call to try to produce the best outputs possible\ninside the time allocated.

The purpose of ``timeout`` is to give opportunity to a primitive to cleanly\nmanage its state instead of interrupting execution from outside. Maintaining stable internal\nstate should have precedence over respecting the ``timeout`` (caller can terminate the\nmisbehaving primitive from outside anyway). If a longer ``timeout`` would produce\ndifferent outputs, then ``CallResult``'s ``has_finished`` should be set to ``False``.\n\nSome primitives have internal iterations (for example, optimization iterations).\nFor those, caller can provide how many of primitive's internal iterations\nshould a primitive do before returning outputs.
